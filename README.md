# raspbian-after-burner

This is an addon installer and remover for raspian.

This is basically a script you would want to run to install extras or remove bloatware (unneeded software like; wolfram, libreoffice, etc) after burning a fresh raspbian sd card.


WWWWARNING! this is highly under construction and totaly my interpretation but suggestions are welcome!
